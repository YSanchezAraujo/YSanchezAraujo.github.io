# Thoughts on learning

Imagine that you put a bowl with some cold rice in the micrwave. After some mintues have gone by and you go to take your food out of the microwave you notice two things. 1. The rice is now heated up and 2. The bowl is also heated up. My intuition is that upon experiencing this you form a causal map, a function like object that goes something like: 

```julia
function microwave(stuff): 
    return hot_stuff
end
```
