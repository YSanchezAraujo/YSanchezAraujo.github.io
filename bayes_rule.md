<h2>Introduction to Bayesian Statistics</h2> 

What is Baye's Rule one might ask, well to be honest I'm not exactly sure. Though I do understand how to mechanically apply it given two or $$N$$ random variables, to answer the question of what exactly it is, is an entirely different thing and albiet, at least for me a far more difficult challenge. 

$$P(A|B) = {P(B|A)P(A) \over{P(B)}}$$
