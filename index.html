<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, this is my academic / professional webpage. I'm a PhD candidate at <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a> currently in my fourth year of study. I'm currently co-advised by Professors Nathaniel Daw, and Jonathan Pillow. I'm also de-facto co-advised by Professor Ilana Witten. My research interest are broad but generally live in the space between systems and cognitive neuroscience, machine learning, and statistics. I'm interested in all of the major sub-categories of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Regarding the brain, I mainly like to think about how it learns, and how it changes during learning. This has almost always been in the context of really down stream cognitive consequences but I also, sometimes, like to think about the slightly less down-stream consequences aswell. </p>
