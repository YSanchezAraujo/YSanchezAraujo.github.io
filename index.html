Hi, this is my academic / professional webpage. I'm a senior PhD candidate at <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>. 
My research interests are broad but generally live in the space between systems and cognitive neuroscience, machine learning, and statistics. 
I mainly like to think about how the brain learns, and how it changes during learning. This is both in the context of systems and cognitive neuroscience. 
My most recent line of work has been on how mice de-novo learn a task and what the behavioral and neural dynamics of that learning look like. I'm in the process of expanding on the results
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.26.582199v1.abstract">outlined here</a>. Aside from basic neuroscience research, I also like to think about sound-statistical inference in the types of models we generally use to describe data.

*About me before the about me*: As you may have read above, I'm a PhD student studying Neuroscience at Princeton (both the town and the school), 
a specialty coffee enthusiast, and a super-amateur at many arts-related activities. Before this, 
I worked as a research assistant for four years—first at MIT in the Gabrieli Lab (working with Satrajit Ghosh and Zhenghan Qi) 
and then at Princeton with Nathaniel Daw. Prior to that, I completed a BA in Psychology at Rutgers–Newark, where I was introduced 
to the world of academia by working in the lab of Will Graves. Even before that, I earned an associate's degree at Passaic Community College, 
not because I wanted to be practical and save money during undergrad, but because I was a derp in high school and thought my 
life afterward would entail joining the military. Going even further back, I grew up in Passaic, New Jersey, and was born 
in Cuba.
