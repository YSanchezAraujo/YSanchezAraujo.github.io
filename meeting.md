<h2>What is Git?</h2>
It's a version control system (VCS) - tells you who did what when, keeps track of almost everything, allows you to feel safe about editing / removing lines of code. So great for collaborations of all sorts - slighly less amazing for single-human use. 

<h2>Git vs. Github</h2>
These are two different things, you can use and have git software on your machine without ever having to go onto Github.com, Github makes things far more convienent for collaborations.
