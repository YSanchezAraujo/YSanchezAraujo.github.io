Hi, this is my academic / professional webpage. I'm a PhD candidate at <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a> currently in my final 6-ish months of study. 
My research interests are broad but generally live in the space between systems and cognitive neuroscience, machine learning, and statistics. 
I mainly like to think about how the brain learns, and how it changes during learning. This is both in the context of systems and cognitive neuroscience. 
My most recent line of work has been on how mice de-novo learn a task and what the behavioral and neural dynamics of that learning look like. I'm in the process of expanding on the results
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.26.582199v1.abstract">outlined here</a>. Aside from basic neuroscience research, I also like to think about sound-statistical inference in the types of models we generally use to describe data.
