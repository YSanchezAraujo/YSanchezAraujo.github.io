        <h1>my computing setup</h1>
        <p>
        I enjoy reading about other people's computing setups so much (e.g., on
        <a href="https://www.usesthis.com">Uses This</a>) that I decided to
        post my own here.
        </p>

        <h2>hardware</h2>
        <p>
        I have a 2019 macbook air that I take everywhere. I thought long
        and hard about going back to linux when I was first considering getting
        a new laptop, but I couldn't bring myself to downgrade to a lesser
        trackpad. <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/11/apple-t2-chip-cant-boot-linux">Fortunately,</a> 
        I can still trade macOS for a linux distro at some point down the road.
        </p>

        <h2>software</h2>

        <h4>internet</h4>
        <p>
        I use Google Chrome to view the internet, and <a href="https://ddg.gg">DuckDuckGo</a>
        to search it. I've become increasingly concerned with giving Google so
        much of my data, and will be moving to Firefox as soon as pinch-zoom is
        stably <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1461360">implemented.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
        Privacy is a human right. The advertising-based funding 
        funding model that the internet currently operates on is antithetical
        to this (for various reasons - see Maciej Cegłowski's excellent 
        <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm">
        talk on this</a>). So I try to contribute to this apparatus as little as
        possible without crippling my digital life. To this end, I've modified
        my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">hosts file</a>
        through this <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">tool</a> in
        order to block any connections to ad servers. Webpages load more
        quickly, advertisers don't track me across the web, and bandwidth is
        saved. I block whatever ads and trackers make it through with 
        <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">µBlock Origin</a>, and I
        keep Facebook, Amazon, and Google from tracking me across the web through 
        <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger.</a>
        </p>

        <h4>research</h4>
        <p>
        Most of the research I do involves digital signal processing of some
        sort, and I've primarily used MATLAB due to its rich and varied
        electrophysiology libraries (such as FieldTrip, Chronux, and EEGLAB).
        However, it is proprietary and slow, and I'm quickly drifting into
        switching to Julia and settling there forever. It's fast, simple,
        and packages like <a href=https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl>PyCall</a>
        allow me to easily use Python packages whenever I need to.
        </p>

        <p>
        I do most of my text editing in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>,
        with the <a href="https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous">neovintageous</a>
        package in order to be able to use vim keybindings, but occasionally
        I'll switch over to <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a> if I feel
        like using a fully-fledged vim setup. Here is my 
        <a href=https://gist.github.com/jyanar/e8611156c56d0b203602d4aea380a2ab>vimrc.</a>
