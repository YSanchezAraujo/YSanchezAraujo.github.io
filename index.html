        <p>Hello! I'm a second year PhD student at the <a
        href="http://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>.
        Broadly speaking, I'm interested in the intersection between 
	Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence.  I'm particularly interested in 
	leveraging ideas and methods from Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian models of 
	behavior and cognition to inform Neuroscientific investigations. 
	Currently I am jointly advised by Professors Nathaniel Daw and Jonathan Pillow, 
	and closely collaborate with Professor Ilana Witten.</p>

        <p>Before starting my PhD I was a reseach assistant working with 
	Professor Nathaniel Daw at Princeton. My work for the most part involved
	writing out a Bayesian model of change point detection and simulating its 
	behavior under different enviornmental conditions. Prior to working the Daw lab, 
	I was at MIT, where I worked as an RA in the Gabrieli lab on a number of projects
        ranging from large scale data mining to what I can only describe as a very
	simple version of full-stack web development.
