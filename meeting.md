<h2>What is Git?</h2>
It's a version control system (VCS) - tells you who did what when, keeps track of almost everything, allows you to feel safe about editing / removing lines of code. So great for collaborations of all sorts - slighly less amazing for single-human use. 

<h2>Git vs. Github</h2>
These are two different things, you can use and have git software on your machine without ever having to go onto Github.com, Github makes things far more convienent for collaborations. 

<h2> Git basic usage (probably most common useage) </h2>
```bash
git clone # grab a repo from some location
git status # check what is different in your version of the repo from what git has "officially"
git add # add changes you've made
git commit # offically add them to git's system
git push # make the changes available for anyone else to see
```
